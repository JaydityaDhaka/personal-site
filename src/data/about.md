# Intro

Hi, I’m Jayditya Dhaka—an engineering student passionate about blending creativity with technical expertise.

When I’m not coding, I’m either engaging in physical activities or spending time with friends (sometimes being incredibly productive...other times, not so much). Whether it’s exploring new technologies or just enjoying a good laugh with the people around me, I believe in striking a balance between work and play. Welcome to my site!
